**Paste** auto**matic**ally. It copies the text to the clipboard whenever you click on it. I often find 
myself typing my email, my full name, my school name,... a lot - which is 
time-consuming. So I have made the extension to copied to clipboard the text I want.

Why it died? 
- Just work on browser
- Because I founded [espanso](https://github.com/espanso/espanso), which is 
more convenient and ~~blazingly fast~~ faster

What did I learn?
- Work with the clipboard feature in JS
- (As far as I remember) How to work with storage, store texts in local storage
