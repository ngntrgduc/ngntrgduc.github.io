From now on, I will attempt to write in English. Because I need to practice my writing skill for the IELTS exam ðŸ¥². I hope this reason will make me write more posts on this blog =)) (in English ðŸ¥²).

# Script loader extension

![](/projects_graveyard/script.png)

It's an browser extension that loads JS script for multiple websites. I found 
some websites are not clutter-free, so I use JS to hide it from the website.

- Why it died?
    - I found out [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) + [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com), work like a charm

- What did I learn?
    - Learn how the `content_script` works in extension
    - There's always has a better version of your project ðŸ¥²


# pastematic

![](/projects_graveyard/pastematic.png)

**Paste** auto**matic**ally. It copies the text to the clipboard whenever you click on it. I often find 
myself typing my email, my full name, my school name,... a lot - which is 
time-consuming. So I have made the extension to copied to clipboard the text I want.

- Why it died? 
    - Just work on the browser
    - Because I founded [espanso](https://github.com/espanso/espanso), which is more convenient and ~~blazingly fast~~ faster

- What did I learn?
    - Work with the clipboard feature in JS
    - (As far as I remember) How to work with storage, store texts in local storage
