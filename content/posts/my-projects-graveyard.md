- Last updated: 12/31/2023

From now on, I will attempt to write in English. Because I need to practice my writing skill for the IELTS exam ðŸ¥². I hope this reason will make me write more posts on this blog =)) (in English ðŸ¥²).

# get-shit-done
[Link](https://github.com/ngntrgduc/get-shit-done).

No more procrastination.

- Why it died?
    - I used this to block myself from wasting time on Facebook, Instagram,... But now I use Firefox for work/learn, and a different browser (Edge) just for social media. Using multiple browsers makes me feel more focused.

- What did I learn?
    - Time in JS
    - F*ck social media


# Script loader extension

![](/projects_graveyard/script.png)

It's an extension that loads JS script for multiple websites. I found 
some websites are not clutter-free, so I use JS to hide it from the website.

- Why it died?
    - I found [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) and 
    [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com), which makes the process less redundant

- What did I learn?
    - Learn how the content_script works in extension
    - There's always has better version of your project ðŸ¥²


# pastematic

**Paste** auto**matic**ally. It copies the text to the clipboard whenever you click on it. I often find 
myself typing my email, my full name, my school name,... a lot - which is 
time-consuming. So I have made the extension to copied to clipboard the text I want.

- Why it died? 
    - Just work on the browser
    - Because I founded [espanso](https://github.com/espanso/espanso), which is more convenient and ~~blazingly fast~~ faster

- What did I learn?
    - Work with the clipboard feature in JS
    - (As far as I remember) How to work with storage, store texts in local storage

More to come...
