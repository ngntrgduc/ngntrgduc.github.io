Hi 🐧. My name is Trung-Duc Nguyen (Nguyễn Trung Đức in Vietnamese). I'm currently a final-year undergraduate majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science at University of Science - VNUHCM.

I love learning about:
- probability & statistics
- machine learning but not deep learning 🥲
- economics & finance (mathematical finance)
- theoretical computer science (information theory)
- psychology
- philosophy
